# DirectX Tool Kit for DirectX 12

http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=615561

Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

**December 15, 2022**

This package contains the "DirectX Tool Kit", a collection of helper classes for writing Direct3D 12 C++ code for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps for Windows 11 and Windows 10, game titles for Xbox Series X\|S and Xbox One, and Win32 desktop applications for Windows 11 and Windows 10.

This code is designed to build with Visual Studio 2019 (16.11), Visual Studio 2022, clang for Windows v12 or later, or MinGW 12.2. Use of the Windows 10 May 2020 Update SDK ([19041](https://walbourn.github.io/windows-10-may-2020-update-sdk/)) or later is required for Visual Studio.

These components are designed to work without requiring any content from the legacy DirectX SDK. For details, see [Where is the DirectX SDK?](https://aka.ms/dxsdk).

## Comparisons to DirectX 11 Version

* No support for Visual Studio Directed Graph Shader Language (DGSL) effect shaders (i.e. *DGSLEffect*). CMO files are loaded using BasicEffect or SkinnedEffect materials.

* VertexTypes does not include VertexPositionNormalTangentColorTexture or VertexPositionNormalTangentColorTextureSkinning which were intended for use with the DGSL pipeline.

* DirectX Tool Kit for DirectX 11 supports Feature Level 9.x, while DirectX 12 requires Direct3D Feature Level 11.0. There are no expected DirectX 12 drivers for any lower feature level devices.

* The library assumes it is building for Windows 10 (aka ``_WIN32_WINNT=0x0A00``) so it makes use of XAudio 2.9 and WIC2 as well as DirectX 12.

* DirectX Tool Kit for Audio, GamePad, Keyboard, Mouse, and SimpleMath are identical to the DirectX 11 version.

## Release Notes

* As of the September 2022 release, the library makes use of C++11 inline namespaces for differing types that have the same names in the DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 version of the *DirectX Tool Kit*. This provides a link-unique name such as ``DirectX::DX12::SpriteBatch`` that will appear in linker output messages. In most use cases, however, there is no need to add explicit ``DX12`` namespace resolution in client code.

* As of the March 2022 release, legacy Xbox One XDK support requires the XDK April 2018 release or later. Upgrading to the Microsoft GDKX is strongly recommended.

* In the June 2021 release or later, the VS 2019 projects of this library build the HLSL shaders with Shader Model 6 via DXC. Since the NuGet still builds using VS 2017, the build-in shaders in that version are currently Shader Model 5.1. See [this wiki page](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTK12/wiki/Shader-Model-6) for more information. The Microsoft GDK projects always use Shader Model 6.

* Starting with the June 2020 release, this library makes use of [typed enum bitmask flags](https://walbourn.github.io/modern-c++-bitmask-types/) per the recommendation of the _C++ Standard_ section *17.5.2.1.3 Bitmask types*. This may have *breaking change* impacts to client code:

  * You cannot pass the ``0`` literal as your flags value. Instead you must make use of the appropriate default enum value: ``AudioEngine_Default``, ``SoundEffectInstance_Default``, ``ModelLoader_Clockwise``, ``DDS_LOADER_DEFAULT``, or ``WIC_LOADER_DEFAULT``.

  * Use the enum type instead of ``DWORD`` if building up flags values locally with bitmask operations. For example, ```WIC_LOADER_FLAGS flags = WIC_LOADER_DEFAULT; if (...) flags |= WIC_LOADER_FORCE_SRGB;```

* The UWP projects and the Win10 classic desktop project include configurations for the ARM64 platform. Building these requires installing the ARM64 toolset.

* When using clang/LLVM for the ARM64 platform, the Windows 11 SDK ([22000](https://walbourn.github.io/windows-sdk-for-windows-11/)) is required.

* The ``CompileShaders.cmd`` script must have Windows-style (CRLF) line-endings. If it is changed to Linux-style (LF) line-endings, it can fail to build all the required shaders.
